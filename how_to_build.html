    <h1>Building and Running Locally to Export</h1>
    This is intended for <b>Mac</b> users since there is a bug in the built
    application <code>.dmg</code> which prevents it from exporting recordings.
    <i>However</i>, when run in <i>development mode</i>, it does work. This
    attempts to get you up and running. <br /><br />
    <h2 class="warning">Warning</h2>
    <b>If these instructions don't go perfectly, this may not be easy</b>
    <br /><br />
    <b>Doing this makes updating the app more difficult</b>
    <br /><br />
    <b>Once done, this will use bit over 2GB of space</b>
    <br /><br />
    You CAN run this and the normal app at the same time
    <br /><br />
    Most of these steps are not specific to this project, so if errors occur,
    look that way for common solutions unless noted.

      <h2>Tools</h2>
      Everything we do is going to be in the <b>Terminal</b>. If you have a
      tool, skip over that. If you have a better way to install, do that :)

      <h3>Git</h3>
      See if it exists...
      <code class="cmd-example">
        $ git --version <br />
        git version 2.20.1
      </code>
      If it says <code> git: command not found </code> or similar
      <a
        href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git"
        target="_blank"
        >go install it</a
      >.

      <h3>Homebrew (needed for yarn)</h3>
      See if it exists...
      <code class="cmd-example">
        $ brew --version <br />
        &lt; some version info &gt;
      </code>
      If it says <code> brew: command not found </code> or similar, you'll need
      to <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">go install it</a>. Be
      patient, this one takes many minutes.

      <h3>Yarn</h3>
      See if it exists...
      <code class="cmd-example">
        $ yarn --version <br />
        1.22.4
      </code>
      If it says <code> yarn: command not found </code> or similar, you need to
      install it. Run:
      <code class="cmd-example">
        $ brew install yarn
      </code>

      That should be it. Now we'll work with the actual code.
    </div>

    <h2>Code Setup</h2>
    From here on, <code>~/Downloads</code> is used as a base directory. It can
    be anything. You just want the resulting
    <code>~/Downloads/tablo-tools-electron</code> directory somewhere you won't
    accidentally delete it.
    <ol>
      <li>
        First, we'll <i>clone</i> the code repository
        <code class="cmd-example">
          $ cd ~/Downloads<br />
          $ git clone https://github.com/jessedp/tablo-tools-electron.git
        </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        That put a slew of files in
        <code>~/Downloads/tablo-tools-electron</code>.<br />
        Now, we'll go there to install <b>a lot</b> of packages
        <code class="cmd-example">
          $ cd tablo-tools-electron <br />
          $ yarn install
        </code>
        That's prints a ton of information to the screen and takes a while. If
        it fails the first time, run it again just in case (I know).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Running the App</h2>
    <b>You made it!</b> Everything should now be installed and ready to go.<br /><br />
    Try to run the app:
    <code class="cmd-example">
      $ yarn dev
    </code>
    That should open the app very much like you are used to.

    <h2>What's next?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Close the Developer Tools that open up in the way - you don't need them
      </li>
      <li>Maybe create a shortcut to the <code>yarn dev</code> command</li>
      <li>
        Updating to new Releases:
        <code class="cmd-example">
          $ cd ~/Downloads/tablo-tools-electron <br />
          $ git pull --rebase <br />
          $ yarn install
        </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't change files in this
        <code>~/Downloads/tablo-tools-electron</code> directory. Or do so at
        your own peril.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
